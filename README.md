# ALX Listing App

The **ALX Listing App** is a web-based property listing interface inspired by platforms like **Airbnb**.  
This project is designed to demonstrate modern web layout practices using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Flexbox**, and **CSS Grid**.

## Project Overview

This project displays property listings in a clean and structured layout. Each listing includes:
- An image
- A brief description
- Price information
- Organized content blocks

The application is fully responsive, adapting smoothly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.

## Project Goals

- Learn and apply **Tailwind CSS** utility-first styling
- Use **CSS Grid** to create multi-column layouts
- Use **Flexbox** to align and distribute elements
- Practice building responsive web pages
- Understand modern layout systems used in real-world UI design

## Features (Current)

- Responsive layout that adjusts to screen size
- Grid-based listing display
- Styled sections and navigation layout
- Gallery layout for images

## Future Improvements (Optional Enhancements)

- Add property filtering/search functionality
- Add account login and user dashboard
- Store listing data dynamically (e.g., JSON or API)
- Add animations or hover effects to listing cards

## Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| HTML      | Page structure |
| Tailwind CSS | Styling and layout |
| Flexbox   | Component-level layout |
| CSS Grid  | Page-level structure |

### **Directory Descriptions**

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **public/** | Contains files that are publicly accessible by the browser. |
| **public/assets/** | Stores static files such as images, icons, and media used throughout the app. |
| **components/** | Holds reusable UI elements such as listing cards, headers, navigation bars, and buttons. This helps avoid repeating code and makes your layout more modular. |
| **interfaces/** | Used for defining the shape of data objects (mostly when using TypeScript). For example, defining what a "Listing" object looks like: title, image, price, etc. |
| **constants/** | Stores values that should remain consistent throughout the project, such as temporary mock data, base URLs, property type lists, or global styling presets. Keeping constants here prevents duplication in multiple files. |

This structure helps to keep the project **organized, scalable, and easy to maintain**, especially as more pages, features, and data are added.
